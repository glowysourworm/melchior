# Tiny C Compiler
The 816-tcc.exe compiler has been brought into the project from the group site headed
by Fabrice Bellard. This is an older project; and I'm looking for whoever has taken over
development / bug fixes. alekmaul (https://github.com/alekmaul) has a repository for
tcc; but it doesn't appear to be under active development. So, I've taken Fabrice's 
older project - which was well documented.

Some more useful links; but mostly unrelated to SNES dev.

# WLA-DX Cross Assembler Compiler
The search for wla-65816.exe source brought up mention of several references to "yet
another ... compiler". Ville Helin has a website (https://wla-dx.readthedocs.io) 
explaining the evolution of his ... projects ;) I think he probably has the proper
source maintained; and that it's very likely that these other github repos have 
basically just stored the compiler executable(s). PVSnesLib has a toolchain that
uses TCC-816, WLA-65816, ... with termial commands. So, lets begin here at
Ville Helin's homepage:

# Update [5/8/2025] TinyCC having trouble compiling
Going to substitute the alekmaul version of tcc - which I believe to have been ported 
from the above Tiny C compiler. Hopefully, this project will be more up to date in 
terms of the include tree.
